        <h5>Winning Cases for Over Three Decades</h5>
        <p>Mario, a native Texan, was raised in San Antonio and spent eight years
          in the Bexar County District Attorney's office. He began trying felony cases, including murder and sexual assault cases, right out of law school. 
          As an Assistant District Attorney, Mario won several high profile cases, including the first successful homicide prosecution in Texas without the 
          discovery of a body, and the first successful prosecution in Texas of a husband for raping his spouse.
        </p>
        <p>For the next 30 years, Mario and his partner and wife, Christine Del Prado, ran a successful defense practice, obtaining successful results for hundreds
          of clients – many of which resulted in dismissal of charges due to excellent preparation and a willingness to try the "hard" cases. </p>
        <p> From 2018 to 2022, Mario returned to the Bexar County District Attorney's office, first as Chief of the Criminal Trial Division and then as Chief of the Major
          Crimes Division.</p>
